My GitHub account will be used for school to better understand open-source software and to hopefully contribute to it.

This repository was created for school and will be used to complete school assignments.

I used the GitHub desktop app, selected to clone a repository, then chose this repository from the list of my repositories.


# About Me
Hi! I'm Gavyn. I'm 23 years old, and I'm 1 of a family of 11.

## My Hobbies and Interests
Though in recent years I've found a love for music, 
my whole life I've been very passionate about software and hardware and how they work in tandem thanks to skilled developers.

My primary goal for this class is to gain an in-depth understanding of coding and web infrastructure that I can use to enhance my personal life
and to drive a lifelong career in software development and passion for computers.

With that said, I cannot deny a love for music and all-things technical regarding it. If you're interested to learn more about music and talk to
folks who love it even more than I do...

## Websites I Use to Gain More Knowledge on Music
	- [Steve Hoffman Forums] (https://forums.stevehoffman.tv) - This site has a lot of music lovers, though primarily vintage, and they know a lot about hardware! It's owned and operated by a very famous audio engineer named Steve Hoffman, who's semi-active to this day!

	- [Audio Engineering Subreddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering) - This subreddit on the social media giant _Reddit_ is entirely about Audio Engineering and the techniques and science behind it. There are a lot of really knowledgeable folks there and it offers a lot of insight on hardware, mixing techniques, and more!
