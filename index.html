    <h1><em>Hello!</em> My name is <strong>Gavyn.</strong></h1>

    <p>By day I'm hard at work in a factory but when the weekend hits I'm a junior developer learning programming and web development. It has taught me to better appreciate all the programming I use and the web development for the sites I use.
       <br><br>My favorite application of programming that I've seen are <em>Resident Evil 2</em> for the <em>Nintendo 64</em> which has impressive optimizations that compressed approximately 700 megabytes of data into 64 megabytes, through writing custom code for the system's CPU that allowed for the playback of custom compressed pre-rendered videos. As for web development, a great example that comes to mind is the official <em>Razer</em> website. They used incredibly beautiful graphics and very sleek styles that really appeals to my personal preferences.
       <br><br>When I'm not handling technology, I'm playing my fabulous drum set! Now isn't this a pretty red?
